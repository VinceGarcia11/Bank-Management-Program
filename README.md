Bank Management Program (Python & R)

A data-driven project analyzing banking customer data to uncover financial patterns and predict customer decisions using statistical analysis, data visualization, and supervised machine learning.

📌 Project Overview

The Bank Management Program explores customer behavior within a financial institution by examining key performance indicators, cleaning and preparing raw data, visualizing statistical relationships, and deploying machine learning models to predict customer decisions.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow using both Python and R.
